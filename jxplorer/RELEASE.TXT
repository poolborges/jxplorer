JXplorer Version 3.2.1 Release Notes
===================================

... This is just a minor release with some incremental improvements.

* Dropped Install Anywhere, moved to BitRock installer for java 1.6 compatibility

* Support for loading LDIF files as command line argument
* Support for displaying raw password strings in table editor using 'mask.raw.passwords=false' in jxconfig.txt
* Some fixes for MAC look and feel; added GTK look and feel
* Added beginnings of Taiwanese chinese language file - only partial.  Reformated chinese to be traditional chinese file.
* Added stand alone 'smart keystore editor' as a sub-project of JXplorer (separate target in ant build, creates an executable jar file)
* Work on ant build file; making sure that shell script permissions are maintained
* Moved source to subversion repository, restructured to allow 'single check out, single build'; more modifications to build file.
